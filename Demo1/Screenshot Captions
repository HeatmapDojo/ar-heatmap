The whole picture of the user interface, including a descirption pannel, 3 slate displays, a title, and a pannel showing available interactive gestures.

2. Description Pannel 
A pannel serving as a sticky notes to display general information of the heatmap. Users can drag or zoom this pannel. 

3.Slate 
The main screens in the demo are based on Slate prefab in the Mixed Reality Toolkit. 
They enable a thin window style control for displaying 2D content such as the heatmaps. 
The content window can be scrolled via articulated hand input. The window can also be pined wherever the user choose to.
We implemented a grabbable title bar as well as Follow Me and Close functionality. 

Follow Meï¼šToggles an orbital solver components to make the slate object follow the user. 
           User can walk to an open space or wherever they would like to view the heatmap and the displays follow them to the place.
Close: Disables the slate object as how users can close a window in a computer.
