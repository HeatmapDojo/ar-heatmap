Heatmaps in augmented reality mode
HoloLens based AR heatmap

This demo was made based on MixedReality ToolKit from Microsoft. We demo a interface for users to manipulate heapmaps in AR space.

The interface consists of 5 screens with different functions. The screens presented in the left, middle and right of users' horizon display heatmaps. The bottom screen showcase several interactions users can try out in this demo, including zoom, drag and so on. The screen pinned on the top serves as an information board to display basic information about the heatmap. The design was inspired by sticky notes in our daily life. 

The main screens can be placed anywhere as users wish. They can also be pinned, deleted and following users (TagAlong feature from HoloLens). One could pin a heatmap on the ground and have other information about the heatmap follow them as they walk around to observe the heatmap.
